# Replaying
Once created, we are finally ready to use the digital twins to run replay simulations. 

The aims can be A LOT, e.g.:
- you want to simulate the impact of modulating the input data you used for twinning, e.g., reducing the insulin bolus
by 30%, and see what happens to glucose control
- you want to evaluate the performance of a bolus calculator you developed
- you want to develop a new algorithm for type 1 diabetes management
- you want to find the best hypotreatment policy able to prevent hypoglycemia
- you want to test an artificial pancreas algorithm
- you just want to generate data using random insulin/meal inputs 
- and so on and so forth...

In the following, we present how to use ReplayBG for running replay simulations and we will provide a comprehensive list
of its capabilities.

## The `replay` method

Replay simulations in ReplayBG can be performed using the `replay` method of the `ReplayBG` object, which is formally 
defined as:

```python
rbg.replay(data: pd.DataFrame,
   bw: float,
   save_name: str,
   x0: np.ndarray | None = None,
   previous_data_name: str | None  = None,
   twinning_method: str = 'mcmc',
   bolus_source: str = 'data',
   basal_source: str = 'data',
   cho_source: str = 'data',
   meal_generator_handler: Callable = default_meal_generator_handler,
   meal_generator_handler_params: Dict | None = None,
   bolus_calculator_handler: Callable = standard_bolus_calculator_handler,
   bolus_calculator_handler_params: Dict | None = None,
   basal_handler: Callable = default_basal_handler,
   basal_handler_params: Dict | None = None,
   enable_hypotreatments: bool = False,
   hypotreatments_handler: Callable = ada_hypotreatments_handler,
   hypotreatments_handler_params: Dict | None = None,
   enable_correction_boluses: bool = False,
   correction_boluses_handler: Callable = corrects_above_250_handler,
   correction_boluses_handler_params: Dict | None = None,
   save_suffix: str = '',
   save_workspace: bool = False,
   n_replay: int = 1000,
   sensors: list | None = None,
   sensor_cgm: CGM = DexcomG6,
) -> Dict:
```
### Input parameters

::: tip REMEMBER
The total length of the simulation, `simulation_length`, is defined in minutes and determined by ReplayBG automatically 
using the `t` column of `data` and the `yts` input parameter provided to the `ReplayBG` object builder. 

For example, if `yts` is `5` minutes and `t` starts from `20-Dec-2013 10:36:00` and ends to `20-Dec-2013 10:46:00`, 
then `simulation_length` will be `10`.
:::

::: warning
The `replay` method will generate an error if the digital twin has not been created first.
:::

## Simulation results

The `replay` method will return the simulation results in the form of a dictionary with the following fields:

::: tip
Beside returning the above dictionary, if the `save_workspace` is set to `True`, ReplayBG will 
also save it in a `.pkl` file using `save_name` and `save_suffix` parameters to save it as:
`results/workspaces/<save_name>_<save_suffix>.pkl`.
:::

## Replaying single portions of data 

To replay single portions of data, i.e., a single meal event or a single day, you can follow this example, which shows how 
to use a digital twin previously created using the MCMC twinning method (stored in `results/mcmc/example.pkl`).
In this example, we will just simulate a reduction of 20% of the original insulin boluses:

```python
import os

from py_replay_bg.py_replay_bg import ReplayBG


# Set verbosity
verbose = True
plot_mode = False

# Set other parameters for twinning
blueprint = 'multi-meal'
save_folder = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(''))

# Set bw
bw = ... # Set bw

# Instantiate ReplayBG
rbg = ReplayBG(blueprint=blueprint, save_folder=save_folder,
               yts=5, exercise=False,
               seed=1,
               verbose=verbose, plot_mode=plot_mode)

# Load data and set save_name
data = ... 
save_name = 'example'

# Reduce the original boluses by 20%
data.bolus = data.bolus * 0.8

# Replay the twin using the modified data
replay_results = rbg.replay(data=data, bw=bw, save_name=save_name,
                            n_replay=10,
                            twinning_method='mcmc',
                            save_workspace=True,
                            save_suffix='reduced')
```

The results will be saved in
`<save_folder>/results/workspaces/example_reduced.pkl`.

A fully working example can be found in `example/code/replay_mcmc.py`.

::: tip
To do the same but using a digital twin created with the MAP twinning method, just set `twinning_method` to `'map'`. 
A full example can be found in `example/code/replay_map.py`.
:::

## Replaying portions of data spanning more than one day (i.e., intervals) 

To replay portions of data than span multiple days, i.e., an intervals, you need to practically do the following steps: 

1. initialize empty initial conditions, i.e., `x0`, `previous_data_name`, `sensors`. 
2. replay the first day
3. extract from the results `x0`, `previous_data_name`, `sensors` to be used for the next day 
4. replay the subsequent day
5repeat steps 3 and 4, for each subsequent day of the interval.

To implement these steps you can follow this example, which shows how to replay an interval spanning two days
using two digital twins previously created using the MCMC twinning method (stored in `results/mcmc/example_1.pkl` and 
`results/mcmc/example_2.pkl`).
In this example, we will just simulate the original insulin boluses:

```python
import os

from py_replay_bg.py_replay_bg import ReplayBG

# Set verbosity
verbose = True
plot_mode = False

# Set other parameters for twinning
blueprint = 'multi-meal'
save_folder = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(''))

# Set bw
bw = ...

x0 = None
previous_data_name = None
sensors = None

# Initialize the list of results
replay_results_interval = []
data_interval = []

# Instantiate ReplayBG
rbg = ReplayBG(blueprint=blueprint, save_folder=save_folder,
               yts=5, exercise=False,
               seed=1,
               verbose=verbose, plot_mode=plot_mode)

# Set interval to twin
start_day = 1
end_day = 2

# Twin the interval
for day in range(start_day, end_day+1):

    # Load data and set save_name
    data = ...
    save_name = 'example' + str(day)

    # Replay the twin with the same input data
    replay_results = rbg.replay(data=data, bw=bw, save_name=save_name,
                                twinning_method='mcmc',
                                n_replay=100,
                                save_workspace=True,
                                x0=x0, previous_data_name=previous_data_name, sensors=sensors,
                                save_suffix='_intervals')

    # Append results
    replay_results_interval.append(replay_results)
    data_interval.append(data)

    # Set initial conditions for next day equal to the "ending conditions" of the current day
    x0 = replay_results['x_end']['realizations'][0].tolist()

    # Set sensors to use the same sensors during the next portion of data
    sensors = replay_results['sensors']

    # Set previous_data_name
    previous_data_name = save_name
```

The results will be saved in `<save_folder>/results/workspaces/example_1_intervals.pkl` and 
`<save_folder>/results/workspaces/example_2_intervals.pkl`.

A fully working example can be found in `example/code/replay_intervals_mcmc.py`.

::: tip
To do the same but using a digital twin created with the MAP twinning method, just set `twinning_method` to `'map'`. 
A full example can be found in `example/code/replay_intervals_map.py`.
:::

## Event handlers
The possibility to alter "offline" the original `data` before calling `rbg.replay()` alone is not sufficient for testing, for
example, a specific bolus calculation strategy, as the meal/insulin inputs usually depend on the current glucose value
and other surrounding conditions which cannot be known before simulation. 

In this context, the ReplayBG `rbg.replay()` method can be fed by a set of callable Python functions, hereafter 
referred to as "handlers", that will handle the real-time generation of specific events during the simulation. 

As such, event handlers allow users to decide whether to use the meal/insulin inputs defined offline by the `data` 
parameter of `rbg.replay()` or those generated online, during simulation, by custom algorithms. 

### Implemented handlers and logic
The following scheme defines the logic followed by ReplayBG to decide the input source to use during simulation. Yellow
boxes represent input parameters of `rbg.replay()`, green boxes represent the input data actually used during 
simulation.

!["Input source"](https://i.ibb.co/J2Z8KSw/replaybg-input-source.jpg "Input source")

As showed in the figure, five different handlers can be defined:
- `meal_generator_handler`: a function that will replace the carbohydrates of `data.cho` with meal data generated according to a
custom user-defined policy when `cho_source='generated'`. 
- `bolus_calculator_handler`: a function that will replace the insulin of `data.bolus` with insulin bolus data generated according to a
custom user-defined policy when `bolus_source='dss'`. 
- `basal_handler`: a function that will replace the insulin of `data.basal` with basal insulin data generated according to a
custom user-defined policy when `basal_source='dss'`. 
- `correction_boluses_handler`: a function that will add correction insulin boluses generated according to a
custom user-defined policy when `enable_correction_boluses=True`. 
- `hypotreatments_handler`: a function that will add rescue carbs generated according to a
custom user-defined policy when `enable_hypotreatments=True`.

Each handler must comply to mandatory input/output specifications described in details in the following subsections.

### Meal generators

A meal generator handler must be a Python function with **4 outputs and 11 inputs** defined as: 

```python
def <handler_name>(
        glucose: np.ndarray,
        meal: np.ndarray,
        meal_type: np.ndarray,
        meal_announcement: np.ndarray,
        hypotreatments: np.ndarray,
        bolus: np.ndarray,
        basal: np.ndarray,
        time: np.ndarray,
        time_index: int,
        dss: object,
        is_single_meal: bool
        ) -> tuple[float, float, str, object]:
```

#### Input parameters
- `glucose`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing all the simulated glucose concentrations (mg/dl)
up to `time_index`. The values after `time_index` should be ignored by the user.
- `meal`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing all the meals (g) up to 
`time_index`. The values after `time_index` should be ignored.
- `meal_type`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing strings that represent the type of each meal in 
`meal_announcement`: 
  - If blueprint is `single-meal`, labels can be:
    - `M`: main meal
    - `O`: other meal
  - If blueprint is `multi-meal`, labels can be:
    - `B`: breakfast
    - `L`: lunch
    - `D`: dinner
    - `S`: snack
    - `H`: hypotreatment
The values after `time_index` should be ignored.
- `meal_announcement`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing all the meal announcements (g) up to 
`time_index`. The values after `time_index` should be ignored.
- `hypotreatments`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing all the hypotreatment intakes (g/min) up to 
`time_index`. If the blueprint is single meal, `hypotreatments` will contain only the hypotreatments generated by this 
function during the simulation. If the blueprint is multi-meal, hypotreatments will ALSO contain the hypotreatments
already present in the given `data` (if `cho_source='data'`) labeled as such. The values after `time_index` should be 
ignored.
- `bolus`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing all the insulin boluses (U/min) up to `time_index`.
The values after `time_index` should be ignored.
- `basal`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing all the insulin basal (U/min) up to `time_index`.
The values after `time_index` should be ignored.
- `time`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing the time corresponding to the current step (hours) up
to `time_index`. The values after `time_index` should be ignored.
- `time_index`: The index corresponding to the previous simulation step of the replay simulation. This basically 
represent the progress of the simulation. 
- `dss`: An object of type `DSS`. Might contain parameters usable by the handler. More about `dss` is discussed below 
in the [The `dss` parameter](#the-dss-parameter) section.
- `is_single_meal`: A boolean flag indicating if the handler is being used by a single meal blueprint or not.

#### Output parameters

- `c`: A float that is the meal amount to have at the next simulation step in (g/min), i.e., `time[time_index+1]`.
- `ma`: A float that is the meal announcement (which can be different from `c` due to carb counting errors) to have at 
the next simulation step in (g/min), i.e., `time[time_index+1]`.
- `type`: A string that is the type of the generated meal. Can be 'M' or 'O' if the blueprint is single meal, 
'B' 'L' 'D' or 'S' otherwise.
- `dss`: An object of type `DSS`. Might contain parameters usable by the handler. More about `dss` is discussed below 
in the [The `dss` parameter](#the-dss-parameter) section.

#### Default handler

The default bolus calculator handler (which is called when no custom handlers are provided by the 
user and `bolus_source='dss'`) is defined in `py_replay_bg.dss.default_dss_handler` and implements a super 
simple generator that is "put a main meal of 50 g of CHO in the first instant and announce only 40g. If `is_single_meal=True`,
the meal type will be 'M', otherwise it will be a breakfast, 'B'":

```python
def default_meal_generator_handler(
        glucose: np.ndarray,
        meal: np.ndarray,
        meal_type: np.ndarray,
        meal_announcement: np.ndarray,
        hypotreatments: np.ndarray,
        bolus: np.ndarray,
        basal: np.ndarray,
        time: np.ndarray,
        time_index: int,
        dss: object,
        is_single_meal: bool
        ) -> tuple[float, float, str, object]:

    # Default output values
    c = 0
    ma = 0
    m_type = ''

    # If this is the first time instant...
    if time_index == 0:

        # ...generate a snack meal of 50 g and announce just 40 g
        c = 50
        ma = 40

        if is_single_meal:
            m_type = 'M'
        else:
            m_type = 'B'

    return c, ma, m_type, dss
```

### Bolus calculators

A bolus calculator handler must be a Python function with **2 outputs and 9 inputs** defined as: 

```python
def <handler_name>(
        glucose: np.ndarray,
        meal_announcement: np.ndarray,
        meal_type: np.ndarray,
        hypotreatments: np.ndarray,
        bolus: np.ndarray,
        basal: np.ndarray,
        time: np.ndarray,
        time_index: int,
        dss: object
        ) -> tuple[float, object]:
```

#### Input parameters

`time_index`. The values after `time_index` should be ignored.
- `meal_type`: An np.ndarray as long as `simulation_length` containing strings that represent the type of each meal in 
`meal_announcement`: 
  - If blueprint is `single-meal`, labels can be:
    - `M`: main meal
    - `O`: other meal
  - If blueprint is `multi-meal`, labels can be:
    - `B`: breakfast

### The `dss` parameter

!["dss variable flow"](https://i.ibb.co/LvzS371/replaybg-dss-variable.jpg "dss variable flow")

Each of the handler has the `dss` parameter as input/output. 

`dss` is an object of type `DSS`, created within the `rbg.replay()` method, that, as schematized in figure above,
has two main **goals**:
1. it acts as a **container** of any hyperparameter and/or data one wants to pass to the custom handler functions.
2. it serves as **memory area**

Regarding the first point, the `dss` objects will contain the `correction_boluses_handler_params`,
 `hypotreatments_handler_params`, `bolus_calculator_handler_params`, `basal_handler_params`, and `meal_generator_handler_params` 
dictionaries given in input to `rbg.replay()`. As such, if one needs to pass specific parameters to the custom handler,
he/she should provide them in the dictionaries as subsequently access them as `dss.correction_boluses_handler_params`, 
`dss.hypotreatments_handler_params`, `dss.bolus_calculator_handler_params`, `dss.basal_handler_params`, 
and `dss.meal_generator_handler_params`, respectively. 

Regarding the second point, being dictionaries mutable in Python, if needed it is possible to store values inside such
parameters of `dss` so that the handler will be able to access to them in the next call of the function.
