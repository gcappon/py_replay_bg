# Twinning Procedure

The twinning procedure represents the key step to create a digital twin. 
It consists of personalizing the blueprint of choice (more details about blueprints in 
[Choosing Blueprint](./choosing_blueprint.md) page), and practically, given 

$
\begin{cases}
    \dot{\pmb{x}}_{phy} (t)= \textbf{\textit{f}}_{phy}(\pmb{x}_{phy}, \pmb{u}_{phy}, t, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}) \\
    y(t) = CGM(t)
\end{cases}
$

where $\pmb{x}_{phy}(t)$ and $\pmb{u}_{phy}(t)$ are the state and the input vectors, and $\textbf{\textit{f}}_{phy}(\cdot)$
is the state update function; it correponds to estimating the set of unknown model parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}$ 
(more details about $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}$ definition can be found in the [Choosing Blueprint](./choosing_blueprint.md) page).


## How to twin?

The twinning procedure in ReplayBG can be performed using the `twin` method of the `ReplayBG` object, which is formally 
defined as:

```python
rbg.twin(data: pd.DataFrame, bw: float, save_name: str,
     twinning_method: str = 'mcmc',
     extended: bool = False, find_start_guess_first: bool = False,
     n_steps: int = 50000, save_chains: bool = False,
     u2ss: float | None = None, x0: np.ndarray | None = None, previous_data_name: str | None = None,
     parallelize: bool = False, n_processes: int | None = None,
) -> None
```

### Input parameters

- `data`: A Pandas dataframe which contains the data to be used by the tool. For more information on `data` format and 
requirements see [Data Requirements](./data_requirements.md) page.
- `bw`: A float representing the patient's body weight in kg.
- `save_name`: A string used to label, thus identify, each output file and result. 
- `u2ss`, optional, default: `None`: A float representing the steady state of the basal insulin infusion (e.g., the 
average basal insulin) in mU/(kg*min). If `None`, it will be set to the average of the basal insulin in input.
- `x0`, optional, default: `None`: An np.ndarray, containing the initial model conditions. If `None`, the model will
start to the default steady state.
- `previous_data_name`, optional, default: `None`: A string representing the name of the previous data portion. 
This is used to correcly "transfer" the initial model conditions to the current portion of data. Practically, this is 
equal to the `save_name` used during the creation of the digital twin related to the previous portion of data. It must
be set if `x0` is not `None`.
- `twinning_method`, optional, `{'mcmc', 'map'}`, default: `'mcmc'`: A string used to select the method to be used to 
twin the model.
- `extended`, optional, default : `False`:  A flag indicating whether to use "extended" portions of data for twinning.
For more information see below. 
- `find_start_guess_first`: optional, default : `False`: A flag indicating whether to set the start parameter guess by 
running a round of MAP before twinning.
- `n_steps`, optional, default: `50000`: An integer representing the number of steps to use by the `'mcmc'` procedure. 
This is ignored if `twinning_method` is `'map'`.
- `save_chains`, optional, default : `False`: A boolean that specifies whether to save additional results of the mcmc 
twinning method. . This is ignored if `twinning_method` is `'map'`.
- `parallelize`, optional, default: `False`: A boolean that specifies whether to parallelize the twinning process. 
This is strongly advised, but it is up to the user.
- `n_processes`, optional, default: `None`: An integer defining the number of processes to be spawn 
if `parallelize` is `True`. If `None`, the whole number of CPU cores is used.

#### More on `save_name` parameter

The `save_name` parameter is of paramount importance. It will be used to "label" the resulting digital twin and save
the resulting parameters in the _results/_ folder. 

Specifically, for a given `twinning_method` of choice, the digital twin will be saved in a file
`results/<twinning_method>/<twinning_method>_<save_name>.pkl`. 

#### More on data used for twinning 

If you have questions like: 
- What happens if I'm using the multi-meal blueprint and I use a day worth of data that do not include any lunch event?
- What happens if I use the multi-meal blueprint and I use data that span just half a day?
- ...

The answer is simple: parameters "associated" to events that are not present in the data used to twin will be just set to pouplation values. 
This means, for example, that in the first case, $k_{abs_L}$ and $\beta_L$ won't be personalized and will be set to population values.

### Twinning single portions of data

To twin single portions of data, i.e., a single meal event or a single day, you can follow this example, which shows how 
to create a digital twin using the MCMC twinning method: 

```python
import os
from py_replay_bg.py_replay_bg import ReplayBG

# Set verbosity
verbose = True
plot_mode = False

# Set the number of steps for MCMC
n_steps = 5000  # 5k is for testing. In production, this should be >= 50k

# Set other parameters for twinning
blueprint = 'multi-meal'
save_folder = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(''))
parallelize = True

# Set bw and u2ss
bw = ... # set bw
u2ss = ... # set u2ss

# Instantiate ReplayBG
rbg = ReplayBG(blueprint=blueprint, save_folder=save_folder,
               yts=5, exercise=False,
               seed=1,
               verbose=verbose, plot_mode=plot_mode)

# Load data and set save_name
data = ... # load your data
save_name = 'example' # set a save_name

print("Twinning " + save_name)

# Run twinning procedure
rbg.twin(data=data, bw=bw, save_name=save_name,
         twinning_method='mcmc',
         parallelize=parallelize,
         n_steps=n_steps,
         u2ss=u2ss)
```

The resulting digital twin will be saved in `<save_folder>/results/mcmc/mcmc_example.pkl`. 

The fully working example can be found in `example/code/twin_mcmc.py`.

::: tip
To do the same but using the MAP twinning method, just set `twinning_method` to `'map'`. The full example can be 
found in `example/code/twin_map.py`.

### Twinning portions of data spanning more than one day (i.e., intervals)

To twin portions of data than span multiple days, i.e., an intervals, you need to create multiple digital
twins, each representing a single day, and then "glue" them together.

Practically, this translates in the following steps: 

1. splitting the data into single days
2. creating the digital twin corresponding to the first day by starting from steady state conditions
3. creating the digital twins of the second day using the same twinning procedure but setting the initial model conditions
to the final model conditions of the first day.
4. iterating, for each subsequent day of the interval, step 3.

To implement these steps you can follow this example, which shows how to create the twins using the MCMC twinning method: 

```python
import os
from py_replay_bg.py_replay_bg import ReplayBG

# Set verbosity
verbose = True
plot_mode = False

# Set the number of steps for MCMC
n_steps = 5000  # 5k is for testing. In production, this should be >= 50k

# Set other parameters for twinning
blueprint = 'multi-meal'
save_folder = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(''))
parallelize = True

# Set bw and u2ss
bw = ... # set bw
u2ss = ... # set u2ss

x0 = None # At the beginning the model will start from steady-state, so x0 must be None
previous_data_name = None # Same for previous_data_name

# Instantiate ReplayBG
rbg = ReplayBG(blueprint=blueprint, save_folder=save_folder,
               yts=5, exercise=False,
               seed=1,
               verbose=verbose, plot_mode=plot_mode)

# Set interval to twin
start_day = 1
end_day = 2

# Twin the interval
for day in range(start_day, end_day+1):

    # Load data and set save_name
    data = ... # load your data
    save_name = 'example' + str(day) # set a save_name

    # Run twinning procedure
    rbg.twin(data=data, bw=bw, save_name=save_name,
             twinning_method='mcmc',
             parallelize=parallelize,
             n_steps=n_steps,
             x0=x0, u2ss=u2ss, previous_data_name=previous_data_name)

    # Replay the twin with the same input data
    replay_results = rbg.replay(data=data, bw=bw, save_name=save_name,
                                twinning_method='mcmc',
                                save_workspace=True,
                                x0=x0, previous_data_name=previous_data_name,
                                save_suffix='_twin_intervals_mcmc')

    # Set initial conditions for next day equal to the "ending conditions" of the current day
    x0 = replay_results['x_end']['realizations'][0].tolist()

    # Set previous_data_name
    previous_data_name = save_name
```

The resulting digital twins will be saved in `results/mcmc/mcmc_example_1.pkl` and `results/mcmc/mcmc_example_2.pkl`.

The fully working example can be found in `example/code/twin_intervals_mcmc.py`.

Basically, the main differences with the case of single portions of data are:
- you need to set and manage `previous_data_name`. For the first day, it is `None`, then it must be set to `save_name`
- you need to set and manage `x0`. For the first day, it is `None`, then it must be set to the final conditions obtained
by running a replay with the same input data, i.e., `x0 = replay_results['x_end']['realizations'][0].tolist()`

::: tip
To do the same but using the MAP twinning method, just set `twinning_method` to `'map'`. The full example can be 
found in `example/code/twin_intervals_map.py`.
:::

::: warning
When working with intervals, you should use the same `u2ss` otherwise the digital twins will have different 
steady-state conditions and equilibrium across the interval (which does not make sense).
:::

### Twinning using extended portions of data

When twinning, it might be useful to run the twinning procedure using more data than actually necessary. 

This is particularly useful to avoid that wrong parameters are set for the last part of the data, e.g., at dinner time. This is also reffered to as "tail effect". 

As an example, think about having a dinner event at 22:00 and the portion of data you are using ends at 23:00. In this scenario, the twinning procedure will
just have 1 hour worth of data to "understand" what is a plausible value for the dinner's absorption rate, which might be challenging. 

For this reason, if one has enough data after the actual portion of data to be used for twinning, it is possible to set the `extended` parameter to `True` and 
also leverage those data points for improving the process.

::: warning
This feature is implemented for the multi-meal blueprint only.
:::

Practically speaking, one has to follow three steps.

#### Step 1. Prepare the input data appropriately

!["Extended data"](images/replaybg-Extended.jpg "Extended data")

As shown in the figure, data must be prepared before running the twinning procedure if `extended=True`. 

To do that, the user must simply flag the meal events of the additional portion of data adding a `2`, i.e., 
`B` -> `B2`, `L` -> `L2`, `S` -> `S2`. No need to flag also the insulin boluses. Also, no need to flag differently hypotreatment events. 

::: tip
Since the insulin sensitivity $SI$ profile "repeats" its pattern starting from 4:00, it is advised that the data to be used for twinning should stop at 4:00.
:::

::: tip
To avoid to increase the computation time too much, the additional portion of data should not go > 11:00 of the next day.
:::

An example code for running this procedure is: 

```python
# Get the hours
hours = np.array([t.hour for t in data.t])
# Find the last idx of the first portion of data < 4:00 
idx_split = np.where(hours == 3)[0][-1] + 1
# Find the idxs with the labels to be modified and modify them
idx_b2 = np.where(data.cho_label.values == 'B')[0]
idx_b2 = idx_b2[idx_b2 > idx_split]
idx_l2 = np.where(data.cho_label.values == 'L')[0]
idx_l2 = idx_l2[idx_l2 > idx_split]
idx_s2 = np.where(data.cho_label.values == 'S')[0]
idx_s2 = idx_s2[idx_s2 > idx_split]
data.loc[idx_b2, "cho_label"] = 'B2'
data.loc[idx_l2, "cho_label"] = 'L2'
data.loc[idx_s2, "cho_label"] = 'S2'
```

#### Step 2. Set `extended` parameter

The second step must simply set `extended` equal to `True` and run `rbg.twin()`, e.g.:

```python
rbg.twin(...,
    extended=True)
```

#### Step 3. Run replays

Finally, remember to remove the additional portion of data before replaying, e.g.:

```python
# Cut data up to idx_split
data = data.iloc[0:idx_split, :]

# Replay the twin
replay_results = rbg.replay(...)
```

::: tip
Example code snippets can be found in `example/code/twin_mcmc_extended.py` and `example/code/twin_map_extended.py`.
An example of already prepared data is stored in `example/data/data_day_1_extended.csv`.

### MCMC

#### Theoretical flavours 

The twinning procedure `'mcmc'` of ReplayBG personalizes $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}$ employing a Markov Chain Monte 
Carlo (MCMC) based approach to address model identifiability issues and manage the improper parameter estimates often 
encountered with maximum-likelihood-based methods.

Briefly, utilizing the _a priori_ information $p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ on the distributions of 
unknown parameters, MCMC allows to obtain a Markov Chain whose stationary distribution converges in probability to the 
posterior distribution:

$
p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, U}(\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, U) = \frac{p_{Y|\boldsymbol{\theta},U}(Y|\boldsymbol{\theta}, U)p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\int p_{Y|\boldsymbol{\theta}, U}(Y|\boldsymbol{\theta}, U)p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})d\boldsymbol{\theta}}
$

where $p_{Y|\boldsymbol{\theta}, U}(Y|\boldsymbol{\theta},U)$ represents the likelihood function; 
$Y:=\{y(t_k), t_k = k \cdot T_s, k = 1,\dots, D \}$ is the vector of observed CGM measurements resulting from input 
$U:=\{\boldsymbol{u}(t_k), t_k = k\cdot T_s, k = 1,\dots, D \}$, with $D$ representing the number of available data 
points and $T_s$ the sampling period.

This chain is used to represent $p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, U}(\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, U)$ in a sampled form by 
extracting 1000 realizations  of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}$, $\{\boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}_{{phy}_r}$, 
$r = 1, \dots, 1000\}$, and consequently used in simulation to obtain a total of 1000 CGM profile realizations. 
Depending on the user's necessity, these realizations can be ultimately used to infer the median CGM profile,
and the confidence interval, resulting from a given $U$.

From the implementative point-of-view, the current version of ReplayBG adopts the affine invariant ensemble sampler
for MCMC (AIES-MCMC) proposed by [Goodman and Weare](https://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-1/camcos-v5-n1-p04-p.pdf) in 2010
implemented in the state-of-the-art [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package.
This method offers several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and demonstrates excellent performance 
in the literature for multidimensional, generic model parameter distributions. A comprehensive discussion of 
AIES-MCMC is beyond the scope of this documentation, and the interested readers are referred to 
[Goodman and Weare](https://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-1/camcos-v5-n1-p04-p.pdf) for further details.

- `burnin` (only if `save_chain=True`): the number of burn-in samples

::: tip
Since hypotreatments are usually related to fast absorbing meals, `beta_H` is not estimated and fixed to 0.
:::

::: tip
To select between the sampled forms `samples_1000`, `samples_100`, `samples_10`, `samples_1`, use the `n_replay` 
parameter of the `replay` method of a `ReplayBG` object and set it to `1000`, `100`, `10`, or `1`, accordingly.
See the [Replaying](./replaying.md) page for more details.
:::

::: tip
To ensure to have the same resulting confidence interval no matter the chosen sampled form, the values contained in `sampled_100`
are chosen as those corresponding to the 1, 2, ..., 100 percentiles of the confidence interval obtained by 
simulating the 1000 glucose profiles using `sampled_1000`. Similarly, the values contained in `sampled_10` are chosen as 
those corresponding to the 1, 10, ..., 100 percentiles of the confidence interval obtained by 
simulating the 1000 glucose profiles using `sampled_1000`. Finally, the values of `samples_1` are chosen as those
corresponding to the median glucose profile of the confidence interval obtained using `sampled_1000`.

### MAP

#### Theoretical flavours 

The twinning procedure `'map'` of ReplayBG personalizes $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}$ employing a Maximum A Posteriori
based approach to address model identifiability issues and manage the improper parameter estimates often 
encountered with maximum-likelihood-based methods.

Briefly, utilizing the _a priori_ information $p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ on the distributions of 
unknown parameters, MAP allows to estimate $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}$ such that it maximizes:

$
p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, U}(\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, U) = \frac{p_{Y|\boldsymbol{\theta},U}(Y|\boldsymbol{\theta}, U)p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{\int p_{Y|\boldsymbol{\theta}, U}(Y|\boldsymbol{\theta}, U)p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})d\boldsymbol{\theta}}
$

where $p_{Y|\boldsymbol{\theta}, U}(Y|\boldsymbol{\theta},U)$ represents the likelihood function; 
$Y:=\{y(t_k), t_k = k \cdot T_s, k = 1,\dots, D \}$ is the vector of observed CGM measurements resulting from input 
$U:=\{\boldsymbol{u}(t_k), t_k = k\cdot T_s, k = 1,\dots, D \}$, with $D$ representing the number of available data 
points and $T_s$ the sampling period.

The result will be a value of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}$ that represent the digital twin and user can utilize to 
run replay simulations for a given $U$. 

::: warning 
Conversely to MCMC, the procedure will produce just one value of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{phy}$ so that it will not
be possible to run replay simulations to obtain a total of multiple CGM profile realizations from a given $U$.

From the implementative point-of-view, the current version of ReplayBG adopts the modified `Powell` algorithm
implemented the `minimize` function of `scipy.optimize`.

::: tip
The MAP twinning method is lot faster than MCMC, however, it is supposed to be less robust to local minima. As such, for
more accurate digital twins, MCMC is advised, while for prototyping, MAP is a more than valuable choice.
